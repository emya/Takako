<h3>Story Behind Torimo</h3>

<p>Torimo is a web platform which matches NY-based users who want to purchase items from abroad (“Requester”), with someone traveling to or from the destination where the items can be purchased (“Traveler”).
<br/><br/>Our goal is to lower the cost for the international shopping and make the world's best products accessible to everyone, while helping travelers cover their trip cost by making extra money with Torimo.
<br/><br/>Our cofounders met in high school in Japan and moved to the United States around the same time, which was when they started building the app.
<br/>Both living away from their home country, they always felt frustrated by the high premiums on imported items, not to mention that a lot of their favorites brands are not available on existing marketplaces.
<br/><br/>They wanted to build a platform to solve this problem and to create a win-win situation where Travelers can use a corner of their suitcases to subsidize their costly international trips.</p>
